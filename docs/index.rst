==================================
ezldap - LDAP, but easier.
==================================

ezldap is designed to do two things well:

* Provide a high-level Python API that makes scripting LDAP-related operations realllllyyy easy.

* Provide a command-line interface that offers the same functionality as the Python API.
  No one should need to know Python/Perl/etc. to be able to work with an LDAP directory to its fullest extent.
